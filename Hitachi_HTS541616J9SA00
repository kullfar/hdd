SMART Error Log Version: 1
ATA Error Count: 54 (device log contains only the most recent five errors)

Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 54 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 4419 hours (184 days + 3 hours)
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was active or idle.

  After command completion occurred, registers were:
